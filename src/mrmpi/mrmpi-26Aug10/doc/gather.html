<H3>MapReduce gather() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::gather(int nprocs) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the gather() method of a MapReduce object, which collects
the key/value pairs of a KeyValue object spread across all processors
to form a new KeyValue object on a subset (nprocs) of processors.
Nprocs can be 1 or any number smaller than P, the total number of
processors.  The gathering is done to the lowest ID processors, from 0
to nprocs-1.  Processors with ID >= nprocs end up with an empty
KeyValue object containing no key/value pairs.  The method returns the
total number of key/value pairs in the new KeyValue object, which will
be the same as in the original KeyValue object.
</P>
<P>This method can be used to collect the results of a
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> to a single processor for output.  See the
<A HREF = "collapse.html">collapse()</A> and <A HREF = "scrunch.html">scrunch()</A> methods for
related ways to collect key/value pairs for output.  A gather() may
also be useful before a <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> if the number of unique
key/value pairs is small enough that you wish to perform the reduce
tasks on fewer processors.
</P>
<P>This method requires parallel point-to-point communication as
processors send their key/value pairs to other processors.
