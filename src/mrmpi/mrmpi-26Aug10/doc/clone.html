<H3>MapReduce clone() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::clone() 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the clone() method of a MapReduce object, which converts a
KeyValue object directly into a KeyMultiValue object.  It simply turns
each key in KeyValue object into a key in the new KeyMultiValue
object, with the same value.  The method returns the total number of
key/value pairs in the KeyMultiValue object, which will be the same as
the number in the KeyValue object.
</P>
<P>This method essentially enables a KeyValue object to be passed
directly to a reduce operation, which requires a KeyMultiValue object
as input.  Typically you would only do this if the keys in the
KeyValue object are already unique, to avoid the extra overhead of an
<A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> or <A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A> or
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A>, but this is not required.  If they are not,
then there will also be duplicate keys in the KeyMultiValue object.
</P>
<P>Note that one of the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> methods allows an existing
KeyValue object to be passed as input to a user mymap() function,
generating a new Keyvalue object in the process.  Thus there is
typically no need to invoke clone() followed by
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>.
</P>
<P>This method is an on-processor operation, requiring no communication.
When run in parallel, the key/value pairs of the new KeyMultiValue
object are stored on the same processor which owns the corresponding
KeyValue pairs.
