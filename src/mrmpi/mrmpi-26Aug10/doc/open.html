<H3>MapReduce open() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce close() method 
</H3>
<PRE>void MapReduce::open()
void MapReduce::open(int addflag)
uint64_t MapReduce::close() 
</PRE>
<P>These call the open() and close() methods of a MapReduce object.  This
is only necessary when you will be performing a map() or reduce() that
generates key/value pairs, and you wish to add pairs not only to the
MapReduce object which is invoking the map() and reduce(), but also to
one or more other MapReduce objects.  In order to do this, you need to
invoke the open() and close() methods on the other MapReduce
object(s), so that they can accumulate new key/value pairs properly.
The close() method returns the total number of key/value pairs in the
KeyValue object.
</P>
<P>Here is an example of how this is done:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = new MapReduce()
MapReduce *mr2 = new MapReduce()
mr2->open()
mr->map(1000,mymap,mr2->kv);
mr2->close() 
</PRE>
<PRE>void mymap(int itask, KeyValue *kv, void *ptr) {
  ...
  kv->add(key1,key1bytes,value1,value1bytes);
  KeyValue *kv2 = (KeyValue *) ptr;
  kv2->add(key2,key2bytes,value2,value2bytes);
} 
</PRE>
<P>The mymap() function is being called from the "mr" MapReduce object,
and can add key/value pairs to "mr" in the usual way, via the
kv->add() function call.  But it can also add key/value pairs to the
"mr2" MapReduce object via the kv2->add() function call.  To do this,
3 things were necessary:
</P>
<UL><LI>call the open() method of mr2 before the map() was invoked
<LI>pass a pointer to the map() which allows mymap() to retrieve the pointer to mr2's internal KeyValue object
<LI>call the close() method of mr2 after the map() was invoked 
</UL>
<P>The second bullet point was accomplishsed by passing mr2->kv directly
to the map() method, but other variations are possible.  For example,
a pointer to a data structure could be passed, which contains pointers
to several other MapReduce objects.  In this case, the open() and
close() methods for each of the other MapReduce objects would need to
be called appropriately before and after the map() method, assuming
they would each have key/value pairs added to them by the mymap()
function.
</P>
<P>You can call open() and close() as many times as needed, but note
calls to open() and close() should always come in pairs.  You should
not call close() when an open() has not been invoked.  And you should
not open() a second time without calling close() first.
</P>
