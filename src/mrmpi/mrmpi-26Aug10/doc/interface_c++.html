<H3>C++ Interface to the MapReduce-MPI Library 
</H3>
<P>This mutiple-page section discusses how to call the MR-MPI library
from a C++ program and gives a description of all its methods and
variable settings.  Use of the library from a <A HREF = "interface_c.html">C
program</A> (or other hi-level language) or from
<A HREF = "interface_python.html">Python</A> is discussed in other sections of the
manual.
</P>
<P>All the library methods operate on two basic data structures stored
within the MapReduce object, a KeyValue object (KV) and a
KeyMultiValue object (KMV).  When running in parallel, these objects
are stored in a distributed fashion across multiple processors.
</P>
<P>A KV is a collection of key/value pairs.  The same key may appear many
times in the collection, associated with values which may or may not
be the same.
</P>
<P>A KMV is also a collection of key/value pairs.  But each key in the
KMV is unique, meaning it appears exactly once (see the clone() method
for a possible exception).  The value associated with a KMV key is a
concatenated list (a multi-value) of all the values associated with
the same key in the original KV.
</P>
<P>More details about how KV and KMV objects are stored are given in the
<A HREF = "technical.html">Technical Details</A> section.
</P>
<P>Here is an overview of how the various library methods operate on KV
and KMV objects.  This is useful to understand, since this determines
how the various operations can be chained together in your program.

<P>Note that each MapReduce object contains a single KV or KMV object (or
neither) when its method is called. (Some methods operate on 2 or more
MapReduce objects.)  When the method completes, the MapReduce object
also contains a single KV or KMV object.  Thus if a method creates a
new KV or KMV object, the old one is deleted, if it existed.  The KV
object is also deleted if a KMV object is produced, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>The methods flagged as "serial" perform their operation on
the portion of a KV or KMV owned by an individual processor.  They
involve only local computation (performed simultaneously on all
processors) and no parallel comuunication.  The methods flagged as
"parallel" involve communication between processors.
</P>
<P>The listed page counts are the number of memory pages that method
requires.  See the <I>memsize</I> <A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A> for a discussion
of what memory pages are and how their size is set.  The methods whose
page count is listed as 4+ all perform a <A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A>
operation internally.  The minimum number of pages this requires is 4.
Depending on the page size and the characteristics of the KV pairs
being converted to KMV pairs, more pages can be required.  See the
out-of-core discussion in <A HREF = "technical.html#ooc">this section</A> for more
details.
