MapReduce add() method :h3

uint64_t MapReduce::add(MapReduce *mr2) :pre

This calls the add() method of a MapReduce object, to add the KeyValue
pairs contained in a second MapReduce object mr2, to the KeyValue
object of the first MapReduce object, which is created if one does not
exist.  This is useful if multiple MapReduce objects have been created
and populated with key/value pairs and you wish to combine them before
performing further operations, such as a "collate()"_collate.html and
"reduce()"_reduce.html.

For example, this sequence of calls:

MapReduce *mr1 = new MapReduce(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
mr1->map(ntasks,&mymap,NULL);
MapReduce *mr2 = mr1->copy();
mr2->collate(NULL);
mr2->reduce(&myreduce2,NULL);
mr1->add(mr2);
delete mr2;
mr1->collate(NULL);
mr1->reduce(&myreduce1,NULL); :pre

would generate one set of key/value pairs from the initial
"map()"_map.html operation, then make a "copy"_copy.html of them,
which are then "collated"_collate.html and "reduced"_reduce.html to a
new set of key/value pairs.  The new set of key/value pairs are
"added"_add.html to the original set produced by the "map()"_map.html
operation to form an augmented set of key/value pairs, which could be
further processed.
