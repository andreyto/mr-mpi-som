<H3>MapReduce sort_multivalues() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::sort_multivalues(int (*mycompare)(char *, int, char *, int)) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the sort_multivalues() method of a MapReduce object, which
sorts the values for each key within a KeyMultiValue object to produce
a new KeyMultiValue object.  The mycompare() function you provide
compares pairs of values for the sort, since the MapReduce object does
not know how to interpret the content of your values.  The method
returns the total number of key/multi-value pairs in the new
KeyMultiValue object which will be the same as in the original.
</P>
<P>This method can be used to sort a set of multi-values within a key
before they are passed to your application, e.g. via the
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> method.  Note that it typically only makes
sense to use sort_multivalues() for a KeyMultiValue object created by
the <A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A> or <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> methods, not
KeyMultiValue objects created by the <A HREF = "clone.html">clone()</A> or
<A HREF = "collapse.html">collapse()</A> or <A HREF = "scrunch.html">scrunch()</A> methods.
</P>
<P>In this example the user function is called mycompare() and it must
have the following interface
</P>
<PRE>int mycompare(char *value1, int len1, char *value2, int len2) 
</PRE>
<P>Value1 and value2 are pointers to the byte strings for 2 values, each
of length len1 and len2.  Your function should compare them and return
a -1, 0, or 1 if value1 is less than, equal to, or greater than
value2, respectively.
</P>
<P>This method is an on-processor operation, requiring no communication.
When run in parallel, each processor operates only on the
key/multi-value pairs it stores.
