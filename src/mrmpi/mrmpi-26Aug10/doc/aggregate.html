<H3>MapReduce aggregate() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::aggregate(int (*myhash)(char *, int)) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the aggregate() method of a MapReduce object, which
reorganizes a KeyValue object across processors into a new KeyValue
object.  In the original object, duplicates of the same key may be
stored on many processors.  In the new object, all duplicates of a key
are stored by the same processor.  The method returns the total number
of key/value pairs in the new KeyValue object, which will be the same
as the number in the original object.
</P>
<P>A hashing function is used to assign keys to processors.  Typically
you will not care how this is done, in which case you can specify a
NULL, i.e. mr->aggregate(NULL), and the MR-MPI library will use its
own internal hash function, which will distribute them randomly and
hopefully evenly across processors.
</P>
<P>On the other had, if you know the best way to do this for your data,
then you should provide the hashing function.  For example, if your
keys are integer IDs for particles or grid cells, you might want to
use the ID (modulo the processor count) to choose the processor it is
assigned to.  Ideally, you want a hash function that will distribute
keys to processors in a load-balanced fashion.
</P>
<P>In this example the user function is called myhash() and it must have
the following interface:
</P>
<PRE>int iproc = myhash(char *key, int keybytes) 
</PRE>
<P>Your function will be passed a key (byte string) and its length in
bytes.  Typically you want to return an integer such that 0 <= iproc <
P, where P is the number of processors.  But you can return any
integer, since the MR-MPI library uses the result in this manner to
assign the key to a processor:
</P>
<PRE>int iproc = myhash(key,keybytes) % P; 
</PRE>
<P>Because the aggregate() method will, in general, reassign all
key/value pairs to new processors, it incurs a large volume of
all-to-all communication.  However, this is performed concurrently,
taking advantage of the large bisection bandwidth most large parallel
machines provide.
</P>
<P>The aggregate() method should load-balance key/value pairs across
processors if they are initially imbalanced.
