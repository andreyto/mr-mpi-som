<H3>MapReduce compress() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce multivalue_blocks() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce multivalue_block() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::compress(void (*mycompress)(char *, int, char *, int, int *, KeyValue *, void *), void *ptr) 
</PRE>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::multivalue_blocks() 
</PRE>
<PRE>int MapReduce::multivalue_block(int iblock, char **ptr_multivalue, int **ptr_valuesizes) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the compress() method of a MapReduce object, passing it a
function pointer to a mycompress function you write.  This method
compresses a KeyValue object with duplicate keys into a new KeyValue
object, where each key appears once (on that processor) and has a
single new value.  The new value is a combination of the values
associated with that key in the original KeyValue object.  The
mycompress() function you provide generates the new value, once for
each unique key (on that processor).  The method returns the total
number of key/value pairs in the new KeyValue object.
</P>
<P>This method is used to compress a large set of key/value pairs
produced by the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> method into a smaller set before
proceeding with the rest of a MapReduce operation, e.g. with a
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> and <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>.
</P>
<P>You can give this method a pointer (void *ptr) which will be returned
to your mycompress() function.  See the <A HREF = "technical.html">Technical
Details</A> section for why this can be useful.  Just
specify a NULL if you don't need this.
</P>
<P>In this example the user function is called mycompress() and it must
have the following interface, which is the same as that used by the
<A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> method:
</P>
<PRE>void mycompress(char *key, int keybytes, char *multivalue, int nvalues, int *valuebytes, KeyValue *kv, void *ptr) 
</PRE>
<P>A single key/multi-value (KMV) pair is passed to your function from a
temporary KeyMultiValue object created by the library.  That object
creates a multi-value for each unique key in the KeyValue object which
contains a list of the nvalues associated with that key.  Note that
this is only the values on this processor, not across all processors.
</P>
<P>There are two possibilities for a KMV pair returned to your function.
The first is that it fits in one page of memory allocated by the
MapReduce object, which is the usual case.  See the <I>memsize</I>
<A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A> for details on memory allocation.
</P>
<P>In this case, the char *multivalue argument is a pointer to the
beginning of the multi-value which contains all nvalues, packed one
after the other.  The int *valuebytes argument is an array which
stores the length of each value in bytes.  If needed, it can be used
by your function to compute an offset into char *values for where each
individual value begins.  Your function is also passed a kv pointer to
a new KeyValue object created and stored internally by the MapReduce
object.
</P>
<P>If the KMV pair does not fit in one page of memory, then the meaning
of the arguments passed to your function is changed.  Your function
must call two additional library functions in order to retrieve a
block of values that does fit in memory, and process them one block at
a time.
</P>
<P>In this case, the char *multivalue argument will be NULL and the
nvalues argument will be 0.  Either of these can be tested for within
your function.  If you know huge multi-values will not occur, then the
test is not needed.  The meaning of the kv and ptr arguments is the
same as discussed above.  However, the int *valuebytes argument is
changed to be a pointer to the MapReduce object.  This is to allow you
to make the following two kinds of calls back to the library:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = (MapReduce *) valuebytes;
int nblocks;
uint64_t nvalues_total = mr->multivalue_blocks(nblocks);
for (int iblock = 0; iblock < nblocks; iblock++) <I> 
  int nv = mr->multivalue_block(iblock,&multivalue,&valuebytes);
  for (int i = 0; i < nv; i++) <I>
    process each value within the block of values
  </I>
</I> 
</PRE>
<P>The call to multivalue_blocks() returns both the total number of
values (as an unsigned 64-bit integer), and the number of blocks of
values in the multi-value.  Each call to multivalue_block() retrieves
one block of values.  The number of values in the block is returned,
as nv in this case.  The multivalue and valuebytes arguments are
pointers to a char * and int * (i.e. a char ** and int **), which will
be set to point to the block of values and their lengths respectively,
so they can then be used just as the multivalue and valuebytes
arguments in the myreduce() callback itself (when the values do not
exceed available memory).
</P>
<P>The call to multivalue_blocks() returns the number of blocks of values
in the multi-value.  Each call to multivalue_block() retrieves one
block of values.  The number of values in the block (nv in this case)
is returned.  The multivalue and valuebytes arguments are pointers to
a char * and int * (i.e. a char ** and int **), which will be set to
point to the block of values and their lengths respectively, so they
can then be used just as the multivalue and valuebytes arguments in
the mycompress() callback itself (when the values do not exceed
available memory).
</P>
<P>Note that in this example we are re-using (and thus overwriting) the
original multivalue and valuebytes arguments as local variables.
</P>
<P>Also note that your mycompress() function can call multivalue_block()
as many times as it wishes and process the blocks of values multiple
times or in any order, though looping through blocks in ascending
order will typically give the best disk I/O performance.
</P>
<P>Your mycompress() function should typicaly produce a single key/value
pair which it registers with the MapReduce object by calling the
<A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> method of the KeyValue object.  The syntax for
this call is described on the doc page for the KeyValue
<A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> methd.  For example, if the set of nvalues were
integers, the compressed value might be the sum of those integers.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "settings.html">Settings</A> and <A HREF = "technical.html">Technical
Details</A> sections for details on the byte-alignment of
keys and values that are passed to your mycompress() function and on
those you register with the KeyValue <A HREF = "kv_add.html">add()</A> methods.
Note that only the first value of a multi-value (or of each block of
values) passed to your mycompress() function will be aligned to the
<I>valuealign</I> <A HREF = "settings.html">setting</A>.
</P>
<P>This method is an on-processor operation, requiring no communication.
When run in parallel, each processor operates only on the key/value
pairs it stores.  Thus you are NOT compressing all values associated
with a particular key across all processors, but only those currently
owned by one processor.
