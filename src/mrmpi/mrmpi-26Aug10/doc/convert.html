<H3>MapReduce convert() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::convert() 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the convert() method of a MapReduce object, which converts
a KeyValue object into a KeyMultiValue object.  It does this by
finding duplicate keys (stored only by this processor) and
concatenating their values into a list of values which it associates
with the key in the KeyMultiValue object.  The method returns the
total number of key/value pairs in the KeyMultiValue object, which
will be the number of unique keys in the KeyValue object.
</P>
<P>This operation creates a hash table to find duplicate keys
efficiently.  More details are given in the <A HREF = "technical.html">Technical
Details</A> section.
</P>
<P>This method is an on-processor operation, requiring no communication.
When run in parallel, each processor converts only the key/value pairs
it owns into key/multi-value pairs.  Thus, this operation is typically
performed only after the <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> method has
collected all duplicate keys to the same processor.  The
<A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> method performs an
<A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> followed by a convert().
