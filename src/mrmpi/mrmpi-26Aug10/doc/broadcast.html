<H3>MapReduce broadcast() method 
</H3>
<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::broadcast(int root) 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the broadcast() method of a MapReduce object, which delete
the key/value pairs of a KeyValue object on all processors except
root, and then broadcasts the key/value pairs owned by the root
processor to all the other processors.  The end result is
that all processors have a copy of the key/value pairs initially
owned by the root processor.
</P>
<P>The resulting set of distributed key/value pairs will have P copies of
each entry, where P = the # of processors.  This will in general not
be useful for further MapReduce operations, but it can be useful after
a <A HREF = "gather.html">gather()</A> before doing a final <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A>
where you want to give each processor access to the entire gathered
result and let it make a local copy of the datums.
</P>
<P>This method requires parallel communication as processors send their
key/value pairs to other processors.
</P>
