<HR>

<H3>Settings and defaults 
</H3>
<P>These are internal library variables that can be set by your program:
</P>
<UL><LI>mapstyle = 0 (chunk) or 1 (stride) or 2 (master/slave)
<LI>all2all = 0 (irregular communication) or 1 (use MPI_Alltoallv)
<LI>verbosity = 0 (none) or 1 (summary) or 2 (histogrammed)
<LI>timer = 0 (none) or 1 (summary) or 2 (histogrammed)
<LI>memsize = N = number of Mbytes per page of memory
<LI>minpage = N = # of pages to pre-allocate per processor
<LI>maxpage = N = max # of pages allocatable per processor
<LI>keyalign = N = byte-alignment of keys
<LI>valuealign = N = byte-alignment of values
<LI>fpath = string 
</UL>
<P>All the settings except <I>fpath</I> are set in the following manner from
C++:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = new MapReduce(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
mr->verbosity = 1; 
</PRE>
<P>Because <I>fpath</I> takes a string argument, it is set with
the following function:
</P>
<PRE>mr->set_fpath(char *string); 
</PRE>
<P>See the <A HREF = "interface_c.html">C interface</A> and <A HREF = "interface_python.html">Python
interface</A> doc pages for how to set the various
settings from C and Python.
</P>
<P>As documented below, some of these settings can be changed at any
time.  Others only have effect if they are changed before the
MapReduce object begins to operate on KeyValue and KeyMultiValue
objects.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>mapstyle</I> setting determines how the N map tasks are assigned to
the P processors by the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> method.
</P>
<P>A value of 0 means split the tasks into "chunks" so that processor 0
is given tasks from 0 to N/P, proc 1 is given tasks from N/P to 2N/P,
etc.  Proc P-1 is given tasks from N - N/P to N.
</P>
<P>A value of 1 means "strided" assignment, so proc 0 is given tasks
0,P,2P,etc and proc 1 is given tasks 1,P+1,2P+1,etc and so forth.
</P>
<P>A value of 2 uses a "master/slave" paradigm for assigning tasks.  Proc
0 becomes the "master"; the remaining processors are "slaves".  Each
is given an initial task by the master and reports back when it is
finished.  It is then assigned the next available task which continues
until all tasks are completed.  This is a good choice if the CPU time
required by various mapping tasks varies greatly, since it will tend
to load-balance the work across processors.  Note however that proc 0
performs no mapping tasks.
</P>
<P>This setting can be changed at any time.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>mapstyle</I> is 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>all2all</I> setting determines how point-to-point communication is
done when the <A HREF = "aggregate.html">aggregate()</A> method is invoked, either
by itself or as part of a <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A>.
</P>
<P>A value of 0 means custom routines for irregular communication are
used.  A value of 1 means the MPI_Alltoallv() function from the MPI
library is used.  The results should be identical.  Which is faster
depends on the MPI library implementation of the MPI standard on a
particular machine.
</P>
<P>This setting can be changed at any time.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>all2all</I> is 1.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>verbosity</I> setting determines how much diagnostic output each
library call prints to the screen.  A value of 0 means "none".  A
value of 1 means a "summary" of the results across all processors is
printed, typically a count of total key/value pairs and the memory
required to store them.  A value of 2 prints the summary results and
also a "histogram" of these quantities by processor, so that you can
detect memory usage imbalance.
</P>
<P>This setting can be changed at any time.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>verbosity</I> is 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>timer</I> setting prints out timing information for each call to the
library.  A value of 0 means "none".  A value of 1 invokes an
MPI_Barrier() at the beginning and end of the operation and prints the
elapsed time, which will be the same on all processors.  A value of 2
invokes no MPI_Barrier() calls and prints a one-line summary of timing
results across all processors and also a "histogram" of the time on
each processor, so that you can detect computational imbalance.
</P>
<P>This setting can be changed at any time.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>timer</I> is 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>memsize</I> setting determines the page size (in Mbytes) of each
page of memory allocated by the MapReduce object to perform its
operations.  Once allocated, pages are never deallocated until the
MapReduce object is deleted, but pages are reused by successive
operations performed by the library.  The number of pages required by
different methods varies; 1 to 7 is typical.  See <A HREF = "interface_c++.html">this
section</A> for a summary of memory page requirements.
</P>
<P>The minimum allowed value for the <I>memsize</I> setting is 1, meaning 1 Mb
pages.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The maximum value is unlimited, but you should insure
the total memory consumed by all pages allocated by all the MapReduce
objects you create, does not exceed the physical memory available
(which may be shared by several processors if running on a multi-core
node).  If you do this, then many systems will allocate virtual
memory, which will typically cause MR-MPI library operations to run
very slowly and thrash the disk.
</P>
<P>If the data owned by a processor in its collection of KeyValue or
KeyMultiValue pairs fits within one page, then no disk I/O is
performed; the MR-MPI library runs in-core.  If data exceeds the page
size, then it is written to temporary disk files and read back in for
subsequent operations; the MR-MPI library runs out-of-core.  See <A HREF = "technical.html#ooc">this
section</A> for more discussion of out-of-core
operations.  These files are created on a per-processor basis and are
deleted when no longer needed.  Thus if you delete all MapReduce
objects that you have instantiated, no such files should exist at the
end of the user program.  If you should need to clean them up
yourselves (e.g. your program crashes), see the discussion of the
<I>fpath</I> setting which describes how they are named and where they
reside.
</P>
<P>If you set <I>memsize</I> small, then processing a large data set will
induce many reads and writes to disk.  If you make it large, then the
reads and writes will happen in large chunks, which generally yields
better I/O performance.  However, past a few MBytes in size, there may
be little gain in I/O performance.
</P>
<P>This setting can only be changed before the first KeyValue or
KeyMultiValue object is created by the MapReduce object.  If changed
after that, it will have no effect.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>memsize</I> is 64, meaning 64 Mbyte pages.
</P>
<P>The default value can be changed by a compiler setting when the MR-MPI
library is built.  Using this flag for the compilation of
the src/mapreduce.cpp file:
</P>
<PRE>-DMRMPI_MEMSIZE=n 
</PRE>
<P>where n = 16, for example, will build the library with the default
set to 16 Mbyte pages, instead of 64.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>minpage</I> setting determines how many memory pages each processor
pre-allocates when the MapReduce object performs its first operation.
<I>Minpage</I> can be set to a number >= 0.
</P>
<P>This setting can only be changed before the first KeyValue or
KeyMultiValue object is created by the MapReduce object.  If changed
after that, it will have no effect.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>minpage</I> is 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>maxpage</I> setting determines the maximum number of pages a
processor can ever allocate when performing MapReduce operations.
Normally this will be no more than 7; see the discussion in <A HREF = "techincal.html#ooc">this
section</A> for more details.  <I>Maxpage</I> can be set to
a number >= 0.  A value of 0 means there is no limit; new pages are
allocated whenever they are needed.
</P>
<P>This setting can be changed at any time, though previously-allocated
pages are not deleted if <I>maxpage</I> is set to a smaller number.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>maxpage</I> is 0.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>keyalign</I> and <I>valuealign</I> settings determine the byte alignment
of keys and values generated by the user program when they are stored
inside the library and passed back to the user program.  A setting of
N means N-byte alignment.  N must always be a power of two.
</P>
<P>As explained in <A HREF = "program.html">this section</A>, keys and values are
variable-length strings of bytes.  The MR-MPI library knows nothing of
their contents and simply treats them as contiguous chunks of bytes.
<A HREF = "technical.html#align">This section</A> explains why it may be important
to insure proper alignment of numeric data such as integers and
floating point values.
</P>
<P>Because keys are stored following integer lengths, keys are always at
least 4-byte aligned.  A larger alignment value can be specified if
desired.
</P>
<P>Because they follow keys, which may be of arbitrary length (e.g. a
string), values can be 1-byte aligned.  Note that if all keys are
integers, then values will also be 4-byte aligned.  A larger alignment
value can be specified if desired.
</P>
<P>When a multi-value is returned to the user program, e.g. by the
callback of a <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduce()</A> method, only the first value in
the multi-value is aligned to the <I>valuealign</I> setting.  Subsequent
values are packed one after the other.  If all values are the same
data-type, e.g. integers, then they will all have the same alignment.
However, if the values are mixed data types (e.g. strings and
integers), then you may need to insure each value is aligned properly
before using it in your myreduce() function.  See the <A HREF = "technical.html#align">Technical
Details</A> for more discussion of data alignment.
</P>
<P>These settings can only be changed before the first KeyValue or
KeyMultiValue object is created by the MapReduce object.  If changed
after that, they will have no effect.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>keyalign</I> and <I>valuealign</I> is 4, meaning 4-byte
alignment of keys and values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>fpath</I> setting determines the pathname for all disk files created
by the MR-MPI library when it runs in <A HREF = "technical.html#ooc">out-of-core
mode</A>.  Note that it is not a pathname for user
data files read by the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> method.  Those should be
specified directly as part of the filename.
</P>
<P>Out-of-core disk files are created with names like
"fpath/mrmpi.kv,N,M,P" where "kv" is an file-type string ("kv", or
"kmv" or "sort" or "part" or "set"), N is a number unique to each
MapReduce object, M is a file counter, and P is the processor ID.
fpath/mrmpi.kmv.N.P.  Sort files are created by the sorting methods.
Part and set files are created by <A HREF = "collate.html">collate()</A> or
<A HREF = "convert.html">convert()</A> methods.
</P>
<P>Setting <I>fpath</I> may be useful for specifying a disk local to each
processor, or for a parallel file system that each processor can
access.
</P>
<P>This setting can only be changed before the first KeyValue or
KeyMultiValue object is created by the MapReduce object.  If changed
after that, it will have no effect.
</P>
<P>The default value for <I>fpath</I> is ".", which means the current working
directory.
</P>
<P>The default value can be changed by a compiler setting when the MR-MPI
library is built.  Using this flag for the compilation of
the src/mapreduce.cpp file:
</P>
<PRE>-DMRMPI_FPATH=foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the desired pathname, will build the library with the
default fpath set to foo, instead of the current working directory.
</P>
