<H3>Copy a MapReduce object 
</H3>
<PRE>MapReduce *MapReduce::copy() 
</PRE>
<P>This calls the copy() method of a MapReduce object, which creates a
second MapReduce object which is an exact copy of the first, including
all <A HREF = "settings.html">settings</A>, and returns a pointer to the new copy.
</P>
<P>If the original MapReduce object contained a KeyValue or KeyMultiValue
object, as discussed <A HREF = "interface_c++.html">here</A>, then the new MapReduce
object will contain a copy of it.  This means that all the key/value
and/or key/multivalue pairs contained in the first MapReduce object
are copied into the new MapReduce object.  Thus the first MapReduce
object could be subsequently deleted without affecting the new
MapReduce object.
</P>
<P>This is useful if you wish to retain a copy of a set of key/value
pairs before processing it further.  See the <A HREF = "add.html">add()</A> method
for how to merge the key/value pairs from two MapReduce objects into
one.  For example, this sequence of calls:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr1 = new MapReduce(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
mr1->map(ntasks,&mymap,NULL);
MapReduce *mr2 = mr1->copy();
mr2->collate(NULL);
mr2->reduce(&myreduce2,NULL);
mr1->add(mr2);
delete mr2;
mr1->collate(NULL);
mr1->reduce(&myreduce1,NULL); 
</PRE>
<P>would generate one set of key/value pairs from the initial
<A HREF = "map.html">map()</A> operation, then make a <A HREF = "copy.html">copy</A> of them,
which are then <A HREF = "collate.html">collated</A> and <A HREF = "reduce.html">reduced</A> to a
new set of key/value pairs.  The new set of key/value pairs are
<A HREF = "add.html">added</A> to the original set produced by the <A HREF = "map.html">map()</A>
operation to form an augmented set of key/value pairs, which could be
further processed.
</P>
