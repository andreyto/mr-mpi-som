MapReduce print() method :h3

void MapReduce::print(int proc, int nstride, int kflag, int vflag) :pre

This calls the print() method of a MapReduce object, which prints out
the KeyValue or KeyMultiValue pairs to the screen.  This can be useful
for debugging purposes.

If {proc} < 0, then all processors print their information, one
processor at a time.  If {proc} >= 0, then only the specified {proc}
prints its information.

Each processor prints every Nth of its pairs, where N = {nstride}.
Thus if {nstride} = 1, all pairs are printed.

The {kflag} and {vflag} setting control the format of the printed
output.  Only a limited set of choices is available.  If these choices
do not match the format of your keys and values, you will need to pass
your data to map() or reduce() function you write yourself to print
them.  These can be invoked by the "map()"_map.html or
"reduce()"_reduce.html methods.

These are the recognized {kflag} and {vflag} settings:

flag = 0 for NULL
flag = 1 for 32-bit positive integer (int)
flag = 2 for 64-bit unsigned integer (uint64_t)
flag = 3 for 32-bit floating point value (float)
flag = 4 for 64-bit floating point value (double)
flag = 5 for a NULL-terminated string
flag = 6 for a pair of 32-bit positive integers (int int)
flag = 7 for a pair of 64-bit unsigned integers (uint64_t uint64_t) :ul

For example, using {kflag} = 1 and {vflag} = 7, would be appropriate
for keys that are 32-bit integers, and values that are a pair of
64-bit integers.

For KeyMultiValue pairs, the {vflag} setting is used to format each
output value in the multi-value.
