This directory contains a Python wrapper of the MapReduce-MPI library.
Before you can use it, the library has to be built as a dynamically
loadable library (as does MPI itself if you wish to use it in
parallel), and installed with the wrapper mrmpi.py in your Python.

Instructions for doing this are given in the MapReduce-MPI doc pages
in the doc directory.
